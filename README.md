#Born2beroot
Born2beroot is a virtual machine project at 42 School, where we have to create a virtual machine using Virtual Box, install an operating system, and do a bunch of configurations. As I am not able to push a Virtual Machine to github, I am going to describe on this ReadMe things I learned in this process.
